# Objectives

In this sprint I want to
- **Gain a solid knowledge about Inference Statistics**
- **Delivery the Tera Challenge**
- **Write at least 2 blog posts: Pandas (3 e 4) and about the challenge.**
- Be familiarized with seaborn and pyjanitor libraries
- Be able to run some clustering examples and understand pos and cons about this tecnique 
- Understand the principles of a good soft skills on DS projects

## Tera Challenge

>Some points of statistical inference are related to different kinds of sampling. Those different methods can be consulted by this book [Bussab e Bolfarine](https://www.blucher.com.br/livro/detalhes/elementos-de-amostragem-331).

# Pos-Sprint

- I could learn a lot, but it was really much to learn in this short period of time. I'll decrease this amount for the next sprint.
- Regarding the objectives, I think that I need a continuo study on inference statistics, mostly using simulation but also using traditional tests. The Tera challenge was a really good experience and I'm happy with the result. 
- I'll not go back to the Moreti's book, I think that this is a little off of the track of I'm following.
- Clustering was not a priority on my job right now, and was that the principal cause that take me to add this on the sprint.
- I'll write a blog post about the project and about the next parts of the Pandas post on the next sprint.
