# Personal Study Sprints

This repository is meant to be about a new way to organize my study, because of the speed that we have to assimilate knowledge, I think is better if we dive our study in chunks of time, like in development projects.

Sprints are time-boxed periods of one week to one month, during which a team work complete a specific product addition. Here I'm using the concept to acquire new knowledge about topics related to my professional life interest.

Each sprint have always some objectives real well defined and needs to be made according your schedule (time you have to study).
